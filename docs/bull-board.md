# Bull Board

[Bull Board](https://github.com/felixmosh/bull-board) is an excellent UI for watching your queues.

This projectâ€™s playground shows a simple integration using the H3 adapter.

- Server handler: `playground/server/handlers/bull-board.ts`
- Route: `playground/server/routes/bull-board.ts`
- Catch-all route: `playground/server/routes/bull-board/[...].ts`

Special thanks to [@genu](https://github.com/genu) for creating the H3 adapter.

For more help getting set up, see this Bull Board H3 adapter comment: <https://github.com/felixmosh/bull-board/pull/669#issuecomment-1883997968>.
